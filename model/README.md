# Model Architecture
I took the LipNet architecture as the main model[LipNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01599)

* model.py --- contains LipNet model(nn.Module) and its wrapper.
* train.py --- train-loop functions.
* dataloader.py --- contains custom Dataset class for my Lip-Reading task.
* augmentation.py --- different utility functions for augmentation.
